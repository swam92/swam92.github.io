			<p>Hello everyone. I bought this domain and threw up a little wireframe markup on a complete.....whim. There was no planning and not much thought; I just figured I might as well own this domain name, and I saw upside in the fact that someone in the future couldn't buy it and put up something that would be heinous and subsequently associated with my name. Now to be honest- the content you see here will still be heinous- some of you may see or read something here so horrible that you'll never come back, but at least I'm in control. The second part of this story is that once I bought the domain, I had NO idea what I would put here. It suddenly felt like the most vain thing one could do. What was I thinking?...I am going to maintain an entire website about myself, for myself, created by myself for the world to see (although likely nobody will)? YIKES! What was I thinking? I do not know- but lets see what happens. Also if you see this, thank you for reading this to the end =].</div>

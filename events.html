		    	<p>Not going to lie- when I read the post from the survey again today, I did not understand what it was asking either. Thank you to the three brave people who submitted responses when to this incomprehensible question : "Should the USNS, the massive Mercy-class hospital ship of the US Navy, be used as a treatment center for Coronavirus patients, or patients needing hospital care for non-coronavirus related ailments?"</p>
		    	<div>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li>66% of respondents (2 people) answered : "No; Even if they do not admit coronavirus patients, and they are extremely careful about who is allowed on the ship, it is likely that the Coronavirus will get on the ship and it will become an extremely dangerous incubator."</li>
		    			<li>33% of respondents (1 people) answered : "Yes; The USNS has the the capabilities and the expertise to keep the virus out of the ship. Even if an infected person comes on-board, the virus will be able to be contained."</li>
		    			<li>0% of respondents (0 people) answered : "I dont know."</li>

		    	<p><b>WFH tmrw</b></p>
		    	<p>I keep seeing all of these headlines (ya i dont read articles) about this pandemic changing the landscape of commercial office space, and how our situation is illustrating that companies can have employees work at home to save on silly things like conference rooms and desks for employees. There are real benefits to increased WFH (or partial WFH setups) like reduced congestion on roads and public transit, people being able to work more instead of commuting, and generally happier people. But are not the people who are saying this already on a team that has established relationships, communications, and trust between people. We have forged relationships with our colleagues and co-workers through years of the 9-5 grind. You cant pull that out of thin air. Like imagine hopping on a zoom conference with twenty strangers, and being given millions of dollars to create an system for scheduling delivery of electricity more optimally to consumers because the power grid is being strained by our collective societal shift to electricity from fossil fuels, and the 1inch x 1inch face on your screen thinks <i>this</i> is the time we're gonna show Exxon who is boss. Think about it...</p>

			<p>Hey people. Its today. The day after yesterday and the day before tomorrow.</p>
			<p><b>USNS Comfort</b></p>
			<div>
				<img src="img/usns_comfort.jpg" class="center">
			</div>
			<p>As many of you know, especially you who live in New York, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Comfort_(T-AH-20)">the Mercy-class hospital ship USNS Comfort</a> docked in New York City yesterday (March 30th). This behemoth of a ship was originally an oil tanker, before being converted into a hospital ship in 1976. The boat is designed to supply the Marines, Army, Air Force, and Navy with rapid and mobile medical and surgical capabilities. Crewed by about 1300 personnel, including about 1,150 medical professionals, the boat provides about 1000 hospital beds for patients. The ship is unarmed; if the ship were to carry offensive weapons it would be considered a war crime.</p>
			<p>So the USNS Comfort has been moved to New York to augment the capacity of the city's hospital systems as coronavirus patients take up an increasingly large proportion of hospital services. The ship is going to be used to treat non COVID-19 patients to relieve the burden on hospitals. But from my perspective on the cushioned armchair, it seems that one infected person getting on the ship will undermine that whole mission. Lets take a look at the numbers that I have used to come to this conclusion:</p>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>The <b>most</b> conservative estimate of COVID-19 patients, which is the official reported number of cases, is about 80,000 New Yorkers. We know realistically that for every reported case, there are about 10 that go unreported, so the real number is much higher. 45,000 of those cases are in NYC. But lets use the <b>45,000</b> number to represent the number of sick people in NYC.</li>
					<li>The ship will hold 1300 personnel and 1000 patients. So lets use <b>2,300</b> as the total number of people who will be on the boat. Again, this is a <i>conservative</i> estimate because patients and doctors onboard will rotate, making the number of unique visitors greater.</li>
					<li>The population of New York City is <b>8,600,000</b> million people.</li>
					<li>So lets use division to get the ratio of COVID-19 patients to non COVID-19 patients (using the most conservative of estimates) : 45,000 / 8,600,000 = <b>0.00523</b> </li>
					<li><b>Finally</b>, lets multiply the ratio by the number of people on the ship : (2300 * 0.00523) = <b>12.</b></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>So these numbers lead me to believe that statistically speaking, if the ship is filled to capacity on day 1, 12 of those people will have COVID-19. It then seems like the virus will be liable to spread quickly throughout the ship given that space is generally tight on any boat, and cruise ships have proven to be a very dangerous place during this pandemic. The thing is once people on the boat become sick, the whole operation is compromised. Could you justify sending medical personnel and patients onto a boat where the virus is known to be? If not- everyone would have to evacuated. It would seem that it would make the most sense to designate the ship as a COVID-19 hospital, give the staff the proper PPE to operate it as such, and relieve the worry about the ship becoming a contamination zone. There might be a reason for not doing this that is as simple as 'the ship is not prepared to handle a scenario like COVID-19 and so cannot commit to doing so'.</p>
			<p>Maybe theres flaws in my assumptions and logic..if there is please feel free to point them out. I just became fascinated with the boat because it is huge and has been used as a field hospital all over the world; so this was on my mind. Please let me know what you think by participating in the survey below : </p>

		    	<h6>March 30th part deux</h6>
		    	<p><b>Breaking stuff</b></p>
		    	<p>One thing that I have been experiencing is <b>breaking stuff</b>. Specifically I am talking about kitchenware- glass cups, ceramic spoon rests/pots, and things like that. I have broken several pieces of kitchenware that I had some sentimental attachment to recently. I am not sure if this is because I am just being extremely careless and just moving around like a brute, or if its because I am home all of the time, and so there is way more opportunities to <b>break stuff</b>. But I wouldn't consider myself to be the most mindful/careful person when it comes to day-to-day movement. Either way this is starting to get really frusturating, and I am started to lose coveted kitchenwares.</p>
		    	<p><b>Follow your Energy</b></p>
		    	<p>A colleague (yes colleague, not co-worker...Im kinda classy like that...oh yeah and I have clients, not customers) of mine said this today in a meeting. Might not be applicable to everyones' situations, but I kind of like the idea. It was said in the context of a discussion about how to stay sane, mentally healthy, and focused while in this quarantine. I suppose what it means is if you don't feel up to doing the task at hand, if you don't feel like you have energy for it, do something that you do have energy for. It also means that you shouldn't feel confined to working "standard" hours e.g. 9-5. Do what you can when you want to. Working in tech, for the most part, we have this privilege, but for example if you have to work market hours than thats that. Keep reading bc it don't apply to you</p>
		    	<p><b>Going public</b></p>
		    	<p>You might be aware, yesterday I made the hasty decision to make this thing public. It was rash, and I was a little embarassed because none of these posts have been proofread, or even re-read. My boss could read this, my coworkers, friends, and family. Fuck. <i>Its easy to be brave on the internet.</i> I think every word on this page was written without being read. Now I am even more hesitant to read them as I know some of you have read them. I also write these posts in an editor that doesn't even have a spell-checker. But now that we're here, I'm planning to put up some real juicy content out in the coming days and weeks. I think if you follow along, you will be satisfied. I'm also going to re-design this thing because it looks like it was created by a third grader in 1995.</p>
		    	<p>March 30th part three coming later tonight...</p>
			    <p>Alright I am going to post more content later this afternoon, but for the time being I can't keep you good people waiting for the results of the last survey. Everyone has been calling/texting/emailing me non-stop and so I figured I'd expedite this...</p>
			    <p>We had seven respondents answering yesterday's question which was: "Would you take the over or under on quarantine ending by May 15th". The responses were as follows : </p>
			    <div>
			    	<ul>
			    		<li>100% of the respondents (7 people) answered : "Over; Definitely still going to be trapped in our houses through May 15th!"</li>
			    		<li>0% of the respondents (0 people) answered : "Under; I think the quarantine will be over by May 15th!"</li>
			    	</ul>
			    </div>
			    <p>So I think theres a unanimous consensus that, unfortunately, we will still be in quarantine through May 15th. Thank you to everyone who participated/voted in the last poll! Without you we wouldn't have been able to discern this crucial data. <b>And</b>, I'm out for now, but check back later tonight for an extended post and probably a new poll</p>

		    	<p>I posted the link to this site on my Instagram. HAH! hahaha. I am truly sorry if you are reading this; the only reason you would be is because you're in quarantine. Hiding out in your house to escape an enemy you cannot see or hear, the CORONAVIRUS! But a quick note on Instagram; it has become the new Facebook. But the haters will say; "You know Instagram is owned by Facebook right?". Yeah I know, but Instagram used to have a unique feel to it; it was cool..it was "relevant". Then it became really popular and people started to juice it for capital. I mean people make careers out of Instagram. Tons of ads now, especially when you're watching stories and then an advertisement for HIMS hairloss product pops up. WTF. And I cant have a "swipe up" unless I have 10,000 followers?! How do you even get 10,000 followers? Basically the cycle continues: people make/find a social media platform (also applies stuff like gentrification), people make good, interesting content, then someone monetizes it and it slowly becomes worse and worse. Remember: there was a time in our lives when facebook was cool.</p>
		    	<p>Remember when the president said American would be open for business by Easter. When he said that I thought Easter was like late April or something...but its April 12th! Yeah I think hospitals will be open for business by April 12th...maybe they'll even have the supplies they need. But this whole discussion begs the question: When do we emerge from our houses and begin our lives again. Lets pick a date; May 15...would you take the over/under on the quarantine ending by May 15th?</p>

			    	<p>The people deserve to know. It seems like because I added the survey above, the previous survey no longer appears on the website. I think because I am using the <b>free</b> tier of SurveyMonkey, they don't allow multiple surveys. Anyways with that in mind I thought I would share the results of the last survey. The question was about how the cleanliness of your house has changed since quarantine started. There was a whopping 3 survey answers. The respondants said the following : </p>
			    	<ul>
				    	<li>66% of respondents (2 people) answered : "My house has been somewhat cleaner since the beginning of quarantine."</li>
				    	<li>33% of respondents (1 person) answered : "My house has been significantly cleaner since the beginning of quarantine."</li>
			    	</ul>
			    	<p>You do the math. People out here cleaning their houses more during the quarantine.</p>

  				<p>Because my website does not have a backend, mainly because I am too lazy, I am going to post a survey I have created, for free, on SurveyMonkey. It is cool that they have this service.

  					<ul>
  						<li>You're always home</li>
	  					<li>Because you're always home, you clean more</li>
  						<li>You never clean, and because you're always home, your house has descended into Chaos</li>
  						<li>If you have someone clean you house regularly, maybe they are not coming anymore</li>
  						<li>You started cleaning as a hobby.</li>

		    	<p>ITS SATURDAY!!!! Second best day of the week after Friday. However Friday is caveated because its really after you get out of work on Friday which is the best. You don't have to worry about going to bed late because you have two subsequent nights to straighten out your sleep schedule. Its also normally a relaxed night in general because everyone is tired from the work week and no one is really pushing for excessive social or recreational activities. Last night I stayed in (duh), chatted up some friends and family on video conferencing apps (see last post), and watched "Ex Machina". Spoiler alert for those who have not seen it: I can't believe Ava leaves Caleb for dead in the research house! I mean it makes sense- if they both left, someone who have to become accountability for the murder which would blow up both their spots. But still- that was a cold-blooded move. Only one a heartless AI-driven piece of scrap metal could make. Brutal</p>
		    	<p>I am thinking of re-naming this page from events to blog. When I began my first post on this page it was named current events- and so I naturally chose to begin writing about the coronavirus. However as time passes, and posts about cats and other subjects begin to be covered, I think this should page should be broadened. I might even create a set of categories within this page to make it easy to switch between different types of subjects (I know a TON of people read this so I really should make usability the most important thing). However this is just to say that you should expect to see a lot of different content on this page from here on out, and possibly an entire re-format. On a related note- I did recieve a request from a user/viewer to add a comments section to these posts. I think that is a funny/interesting idea that will make the page a lot more entertaining. <b>Please comment your thoughts about that idea below.</b> The only problem with that is that I will have to add a backend, create an API, and because I am hosting this on the most basic of basics- Github pages- I will probably have to change my hosting service (No hate for Github pages- they made setting up this website really really easy- but the capabilities are limited when you get to applications with servers).</p>
		    	<p>There was a train fire in NYC yesterday. It looked absolutely horrifying. The fire is thought to be a criminal act, related to similar fires at other stations in the same area that day. There was a picture of a burned out train car that really made me sad. Its a similar sadness to that of seeing the streets of NYC empty. Two days ago I took a bikeride up to central park and rode a lap around the park. While the park was busy, riding the 60 blocks north and south were not. On my way home riding south I actually rode through Times Square and did not even notice I was there for a minute because of how empty it was. The streets around iconic New York landmarks like 30 Rockefeller, Radio City Music Show, The Tonight Show, and the Late Show were completely barren. More than interesting or shocking, these sites made me sad.</p>
		    	<p>Now for a coronavirus related thought (please take this with a grain of salt because I am not a doctor, public health expert, economist, or lawmaker). Yesterday a 2.2 Trillion dollar stimulus bill was passed. That amount of money is absolutely shocking, given that we don't have the cash to pay for it, and so my generation and the generations after me will be footing the bill. The virus only seriously harms, and in unfortunate cases kills, a small percentage of people like the elderly and the immunocompromised. Healthy and less-healthy people are unlikely to see serious damage especially if the medical system is prepared. Even vulnerable groups are less likely to realize negative consequences if hospitals are adaquately stocked and equipped to take patients. I <b>wonder</b> why we could not have taken a fraction of that 2.2 Trillion dollar stimulus, lets say between 100-200 billion dollars, let "healthy" populations continue to participate in economic activity while encouraging social-distancing measures, hand-washing, micro-quarantines in outbraek areas, and other public health initiatives. With the money we could have immediately mobilized a huge workforce to build hospitals and source/create adaquate medical supplies; meanwhile we could have imposed a quarantine on vulnerable populations and provided them with services they would need to flourish while under quarantine. This would provide us with a medical system sufficient to care for anyone and everyone that gets sick, and relieve the need of spending 2.2 Trillion dollars to bailout an economy that will now be on pause indefinitely (and may very well require more capital injections). Again I am no economist, buy if this 2.2T debt could cause economic issues down the road that could very much also create great human sufferring. This idea may seem a bit callous- but to my knowledge, the fatality rate of the disease is very much impacted by the ability of healthcare systems to absorb the vast amount of patients.</p>

		  		<p>Katie and I have a full-time cat at home we call Bear. Katie has had bear for close to seven years now. But in addition to bear, we also foster cats, and sometimes kittens, from Best Friends Animal Society in Manhattan (BFA). BFA needs fosters for several reasons. When BFA recieves a cat from animal control (which is where all of their cats come from), it must be kept away from other cats for a minimum of ten days as to not potentially pass on any diseases it may have. Additionally sometimes the cats have known issues, and so foster parents take care of the cats, which often includes trips to the vet and administering medicine, until the cat get well and can be adopted out. As fosters we do not handle any of the logistics for adoption, besides returning the cat(s) to BFA. Additionally BFA gets many kittens so small that they need to be specially cared for (kept in a sterile kitten room) and bottle fed. When kittens get big enough to leave the kitten room, but not big enough to be spayed/neutered, which is a requirement for adoption, they go to foster parents. The foster parents will make sure the kittens are growing at the correct rate, take them to any necessary vet appointments including their spay/neuter surgeries, and then return the kittens to BFA where they will be adopted.</p>
		  		<p>Right now we have three black kittens: Cadillac, Ford & Lexus. We have actually had these kittens for close to a month and a half, and they have already been spayed and neutered, but because of the virus situation, we are still holding on to them. When we got them they were under one pound- now they are well over three pounds. They are growing quickly and getting crazy. While they sleep 80% of the time, the other 20% of the time they go absolutely wild. Here are some pictures : </p>

		  		<p>I decided to respond to a politically charged comment on Facebook today. The tone of my response was light, but it was attacked pretty harshly. I responded by telling the person that I bet everything I own that they did not read one word of the proposed bills, and if they indeed had read the bills, please post links to them. Three hours later I had the two PDF's above. These are links to the Republican's and Democrat's proposed econoimc stimulus bills. In addition, this facebook user has provided me with a good resource to source future bills (that I will then post here). Additionally, the facebook user was able to pwn a libtard on the interwebz. All is right in the world...Except for the pandemic.</p>
		  		<p>Also working from home really isn't too bad.  I could really get used to it. Its nice to have a full kitchen to cook lunch in, and the cats running around. It takes a little discipline but its really not bad for now.</p>

		  	<p>Wake up at 9:18am...walk out of bed and do a few squats. Feeling pretty good for the workday....okay so go to the cabinet and grab the jar of coffee. Just enough left for the morning pot. Great. Put in a folder, scoop out the grinds, and get the coffee going. It smells amazing...after a few minutes I am starting to get ready to pour a cup. Then I remember- no milk. Oh shit. Do I go out and grab milk or drink it black? Fuck it...this is America...I'm getting the goddamn milk. Okay shit I spent my last five bucks yesterday....I've got a jar of cash in the kitchen but thats supposed to be for a vacation..a vacation that is beginning to seem more unlikely. Okay where is Katie's wallet...cant find it. I'm diving into the jar to grab a five. Its cold and I'm barely wearing any shorts...so I know I'm not going to the grocery store. I'm going to the corner store....Kim's. Kim's has milk, but also a bunch of people in it. Fuck it. Buy the milk. Liter for $3.49. Woman behind the counter is wearing a mask...hands me to one dollar bill, two quarters, and a penny. Left that shit in the jacket pocket because I dont want any virus.</p>

		  	<p>New York State is now on PAUSE. PAUSE is an acronym for "Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone". In the coming days it will be interesting to see how seriously this is enforced. I hope that it will be used to break up social gatherings instead of targeting individuals getting some fresh air- but that remains to be seen. Its also unclear what punishment will be used to enforce this. Hopefully will work to slow to tranmission rate and give us some time to ramp up the hospital system and source adaquate supplies</p>
		  	<p>There was also some news from Washington today that a coronavirus stimulus bill package worth 1.8 Trillion dollars failed to pass in the Senate in a 47-47 vote. I have been unable to source the primary text of this bill, but I can only assume it attempted to swindle in some inappropriate measures during a time of crisis. Apparently the bill extended a line of credit worth close to 500 billion dollars to the Federal Reserve to bailout unspecified industries. I consider this to be a serious waste of taxpayer money and another stain on the current administration. The fact that the government has not invoked its powers to help manufacture and distribute desperately needed medical supplies, while at the same time using trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out industries, is deeply troubling. I think the juxtaposition of the proposed stimulus package, along with the guise of a "small federal government" being used to justify not invoking the Defense Production Act, shows the current administration to be hypocritical; hypocritical even when their "ideals" will be paid for up-front with American lives, and maintained by bleeding the country of future prosperity as our credit rating drops with our credibility, and interest payments pile up. The Trump Organization recieving any of this bailout money would be absolutely unacceptable. I hope the politicians representing us will do whats right.</p>
		  	<p>S&P futures are currently down about 5%. Theres going to be a whole lot more economic pain tomorrow morning. I hope this doesn't force the Democrat's hand to pass an incomplete and harmful bailout plan.</p>
		  	<p>On a more personal note, today marks a week almost completely quarantined in my apartment. There are definitely ups and downs, sometimes it can be deeply depressing, especially with everything thats going on, and sometimes it can be actually quite nice to have some actual free time, free from external pressures, to sit and think. But the main point of this post is that I am not excited at all about another week working from home. My apartment simply isn't large enough to really seperate my work life from my home life (which is my entire life now). I am hoping I will be able to slowly adapt to a working from home situation by sticking to a routine and just being dilligent with my state of mind as I approach each work day. Working as a software developer, I am granted a large amount of autonomy to begin with, and largely I am the person who makes sure I am accountable. And so working from home it can be easy to get sidetracked. I am intent on getting into a good routine with work both because it will help pass the time and well, because it is my job. The feeling of accomplishment after a day's work is better than not doing much work and being on youtube all day. Plus, I can watch youtube on my commute home. </p>

		    <p>I really wish I could get access to real-time daily ridership data from the MTA regarding the NYC subway system. Unfortunately that is something I am still looking for. In the meantime, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-sex-guidance.pdf"> at least we have NYC's guidelines for safe sex during the CovID-19 outbreak.</a> I hope I am wrong but this viral outbreak, as I said towards the end of the last post, seems to look like its going to turn even way uglier in the coming weeks and days. I really hope the country can work together to begin producing, distributing, and sharing vital equipement, or else I imagine a tragedy like we have not seen before. </p>

		    <p>I slept until almost 11am today. That is rare for me, but we went to bed late last night. I almost felt pressued to continue sleeping because it would help the day pass faster. Katie slept until past 2pm. I will probably come back to this post later, but for fun I thought I'd make a list of the items we are beginning to run low on/items I have only just realized I enjoy</p>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>Sweets: candy, icecream, chocolate</li>
		    	<li>Juice (should fall into the sweets categories)</li>
		    	<li>Food to eat that doesn't require preparation (something decides crackers)</li>
		    	<li>A yogamat to help with excercises on the hard, wooden floor</li>
		    	<li>Alcohol</li>
		    	<li>Coffee</li>
		    	<li>Some sort of gaming console</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>All of these things are attainable right now, and hopefully will continue to be. Its just in the spirit of the quarantine the minimizing movement we have not re-stocked. Also, it is kind of a good challenge to withold from yourself the things you desire</p>

		    	<p>Day 6 of quarantine. Today I left the house to go for a walk, and it felt amazing. I truly had not left the house for a few days and this was much needed. But that sweet taste of the outdoors, of freedom, was so sweet, that I ended up going on two other walks. The direction that I walked in at each intserction was the one with the least people, as well as routes where there was no visible scaffolding. I avoided scaffolding because it tends to get dark and dingy underneath it, the air tends to feel stale, and it generally feels less clean that a sidwalk without scaffolding.</p>
		    	<p>I listened to Cuomo's address this morning. It was pretty surreal to see the journalists seated in chairs 6 feet away from eachother. I was encouraged to hear that as of 8pm Saturday evening, all non-essential businesses were being shuttered. However when I did a bit more research, I found of list of essential businesses, and it was sobering to see what is considered essential. Many of these businesses are essential, and NYC has a GDP that is close to 2 Trillion dollars, which is close to 10% of the GDP of the entire USA. This area is so vital the US economy, and the list of essential businesses reflects this point. The following are considered to be essential businesses (sourced from

				<p>I am trying to get the exact number, and this post will be updated later if I find it, but the MTA ridership was over 1 million people today. If just 1% of those people are infected, 10,000 people exposed countless others to the virus today. We cannot expect everything to shut down but the public health costs of not doing so are beginning to look staggering. Today for the first time, I felt a simple sadness about the situation; sadness about the human tragedy we are beginning to suffer through </p>

		    	<p>Day four of my quarantine. Prior to that, I had been in a state of semi-quarantine and practicing a social distancing regime. My scope into daily life in Manhattan is limited by what I can see through my living room windows overlooking what is normally a busy intersection in the SoHo neighborhood. There are minimal people outside; the usual nightly music from the bars and restaurants, despite having been muffled recently by a zealous neighborhood association, is completely muted. However, there is the sound of an occasional car or truck driving by. I wonder how serious people around the city and the state have been in heeding the reccomendations of our governor and the more recent guidelines from the president. What is worrying me is that despite efforts by many of us to restrict the spread, their are still so many people who are out and about every day.</p>

		    		<li>Medical professionals</li>
		    		<li>MTA (including Metro North & LIRR), Port Authority, NJTransit workers</li>

		    		<li>Couriers</li>
		    		<li>Air Traffic Control</li>
		    		<li>Janitorial staff</li>
		    	</ul>
		    	<p>These industries must include tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people in the NYC area. And not included are all of the people who are not heeding quarantine and social distancing guidelines, or are taking them seriously but are taking a much needed stroll or walking their dog. It seems like even with our best efforts the virus may still spread to many more people. On a lighter note- most of our snack food has been depleted. Everything remaining needs to be cooked or otherwise prepared somehow. Maybe this is a good thing though.</p>

		    	<p>Day four of my quarantine. Prior to that, I had been in a state of semi-quarantine and practicing a social distancing regime. My scope into daily life in Manhattan is limited by what I can see through my living room windows overlooking what is normally a busy intersection in the SoHo neighborhood. There are minimal people outside; the usual nightly music from the bars and restaurants, despite having been muffled recently by a zealous neighborhood association, is completely muted. However, there is the sound of an occasional car or truck driving by. I wonder how serious people around the city and the state have been in heeding the reccomendations of our governor and the more recent guidelines from the president. What is worrying me is that despite efforts by many of us to restrict the spread, their are still so many people who are out and about every day.</p>

		    		<li>Janitorial staff</li>
		    	</ul>
		    	<p>These industries must include tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people in the NYC area. And not included are all of the people who are not heeding quarantine and social distancing guidelines, or are taking them seriously but are taking a much needed stroll or walking their dog. It seems like even with our best efforts the virus may still spread to many more people. On a lighter note- most of our snack food has been depleted. Everything remaining needs to be cooked or otherwise prepared somehow. Maybe this is a good thing though.</p>

		    	<p>Day 6 of quarantine. Today I left the house to go for a walk, and it felt amazing. I truly had not left the house for a few days and this was much needed. But that sweet taste of the outdoors, of freedom, was so sweet, that I ended up going on two other walks. The direction that I walked in at each intserction was the one with the least people, as well as routes where there was no visible scaffolding. I avoided scaffolding because it tends to get dark and dingy underneath it, the air tends to feel stale, and it generally feels less clean that a sidwalk without scaffolding.</p>
		    	<p>I listened to Cuomo's address this morning. It was pretty surreal to see the journalists seated in chairs 6 feet away from eachother. I was encouraged to hear that as of 8pm Saturday evening, all non-essential businesses were being shuttered. However when I did a bit more research, I found of list of essential businesses, and it was sobering to see what is considered essential. Many of these businesses are essential, and NYC has a GDP that is close to 2 Trillion dollars, which is close to 10% of the GDP of the entire USA. This area is so vital the US economy, and the list of essential businesses reflects this point. The following are considered to be essential businesses (sourced from

				<p>I am trying to get the exact number, and this post will be updated later if I find it, but the MTA ridership was over 1 million people today. If just 1% of those people are infected, 10,000 people exposed countless others to the virus today. We cannot expect everything to shut down but the public health costs of not doing so are beginning to look staggering. Today for the first time, I felt a simple sadness about the situation; sadness about the human tragedy we are beginning to suffer through </p>

		    <p>I really wish I could get access to real-time daily ridership data from the MTA regarding the NYC subway system. Unfortunately that is something I am still looking for. In the meantime, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-sex-guidance.pdf"> at least we have NYC's guidelines for safe sex during the CovID-19 outbreak.</a> I hope I am wrong but this viral outbreak, as I said towards the end of the last post, seems to look like its going to turn even way uglier in the coming weeks and days. I really hope the country can work together to begin producing, distributing, and sharing vital equipement, or else I imagine a tragedy like we have not seen before. </p>

		    <p>I slept until almost 11am today. That is rare for me, but we went to bed late last night. I almost felt pressued to continue sleeping because it would help the day pass faster. Katie slept until past 2pm. I will probably come back to this post later, but for fun I thought I'd make a list of the items we are beginning to run low on/items I have only just realized I enjoy</p>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>Sweets: candy, icecream, chocolate</li>
		    	<li>Juice (should fall into the sweets categories)</li>
		    	<li>Food to eat that doesn't require preparation (something decides crackers)</li>
		    	<li>A yogamat to help with excercises on the hard, wooden floor</li>
		    	<li>Alcohol</li>
		    	<li>Coffee</li>
		    	<li>Some sort of gaming console</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>All of these things are attainable right now, and hopefully will continue to be. Its just in the spirit of the quarantine the minimizing movement we have not re-stocked. Also, it is kind of a good challenge to withold from yourself the things you desire</p>

		  	<p>New York State is now on PAUSE. PAUSE is an acronym for "Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone". In the coming days it will be interesting to see how seriously this is enforced. I hope that it will be used to break up social gatherings instead of targeting individuals getting some fresh air- but that remains to be seen. Its also unclear what punishment will be used to enforce this. Hopefully will work to slow to tranmission rate and give us some time to ramp up the hospital system and source adaquate supplies</p>
		  	<p>There was also some news from Washington today that a coronavirus stimulus bill package worth 1.8 Trillion dollars failed to pass in the Senate in a 47-47 vote. I have been unable to source the primary text of this bill, but I can only assume it attempted to swindle in some inappropriate measures during a time of crisis. Apparently the bill extended a line of credit worth close to 500 billion dollars to the Federal Reserve to bailout unspecified industries. I consider this to be a serious waste of taxpayer money and another stain on the current administration. The fact that the government has not invoked its powers to help manufacture and distribute desperately needed medical supplies, while at the same time using trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out industries, is deeply troubling. I think the juxtaposition of the proposed stimulus package, along with the guise of a "small federal government" being used to justify not invoking the Defense Production Act, shows the current administration to be hypocritical; hypocritical even when their "ideals" will be paid for up-front with American lives, and maintained by bleeding the country of future prosperity as our credit rating drops with our credibility, and interest payments pile up. The Trump Organization recieving any of this bailout money would be absolutely unacceptable. I hope the politicians representing us will do whats right.</p>
		  	<p>S&P futures are currently down about 5%. Theres going to be a whole lot more economic pain tomorrow morning. I hope this doesn't force the Democrat's hand to pass an incomplete and harmful bailout plan.</p>
		  	<p>On a more personal note, today marks a week almost completely quarantined in my apartment. There are definitely ups and downs, sometimes it can be deeply depressing, especially with everything thats going on, and sometimes it can be actually quite nice to have some actual free time, free from external pressures, to sit and think. But the main point of this post is that I am not excited at all about another week working from home. My apartment simply isn't large enough to really seperate my work life from my home life (which is my entire life now). I am hoping I will be able to slowly adapt to a working from home situation by sticking to a routine and just being dilligent with my state of mind as I approach each work day. Working as a software developer, I am granted a large amount of autonomy to begin with, and largely I am the person who makes sure I am accountable. And so working from home it can be easy to get sidetracked. I am intent on getting into a good routine with work both because it will help pass the time and well, because it is my job. The feeling of accomplishment after a day's work is better than not doing much work and being on youtube all day. Plus, I can watch youtube on my commute home. </p>

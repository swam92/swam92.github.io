		    	<p>Day four of my quarantine. Prior to that, I had been in a state of semi-quarantine and practicing a social distancing regime. My scope into daily life in Manhattan is limited by what I can see through my living room windows overlooking what is normally a busy intersection in the SoHo neighborhood. There are minimal people outside; the usual nightly music from the bars and restaurants, despite having been muffled recently by a zealous neighborhood association, is completely muted. However, there is the sound of an occasional car or truck driving by. I wonder how serious people around the city and the state have been in heeding the reccomendations of our governor and the more recent guidelines from the president. What is worrying me is that despite efforts by many of us to restrict the spread, their are still so many people who are out and about every day.</p>
		    	<ul>
		    		<li>Medical professionals</li>
		    		<li>MTA (including Metro North & LIRR), Port Authority, NJTransit workers</li>
		    		<li>Critical government employees</li>
		    		<li>Cashiers and other grocery store workers</li>
		    		<li>Sanitation</li>
		    		<li>Police</li>
		    		<li>Fire</li>
		    		<li>Chefs</li>
		    		<li>Couriers</li>
		    		<li>Air Traffic Control</li>
		    		<li>Janitorial staff</li>
		    	</ul>
		    	<p>These industries must include tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people in the NYC area. And not included are all of the people who are not heeding quarantine and social distancing guidelines, or are taking them seriously but are taking a much needed stroll or walking their dog. It seems like even with our best efforts the virus may still spread to many more people. On a lighter note- most of our snack food has been depleted. Everything remaining needs to be cooked or otherwise prepared somehow. Maybe this is a good thing though.</p>

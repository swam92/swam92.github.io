     		<p class="center"><b>Scamazon</b></p> <!-- class="flip-hor"-->
     		<p>I've recently uncovered what I believe to be a massive scam- Proferred by the massive technology syndicate Amazon against we the people. It all started after deciding to watch the critically aclaimed, sordid television drama the Sopranos. The Sopranos explores the nuances of interpersonal relationships in the backdrop of a brutal criminal conspiracy, which, along with his family, Tony Soprano seeks to exert an element of control in an increasingly chaotic world. After exhausting the "free" areas of the usual suspects- Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and Apple/ we realized we'd need to rent or buy the show. Netflix and Hulu didn't have it so we checked over on Amazon Prime Video. At the time the first season cost $10 to rent. Now it costs $25 to buy, without a rental option, but that doesn't diminish what is coming next.</p>
					<div class="row table-row">

				  		<div class="col-4"><img src="img/amzn_season_6.png"></div>
				  		<div class="col-4"><img src="img/appl_series.png"></div>
				</div>


<p>So next we checked Apple TV. It was listed for sale, with no rental option, for $125. So I did the math. At $10 a season for 6 seasons thats $60. Apple was selling the whole series for $125. Thats over 200% more expensive. A pretty giant price difference. Ironically a debate about the ethics of Amazon and Apple ensued. Which company was more ethical? If it was Apple would it be worth it to pay over 200% more to reward their only relatively ethical behavior? In my mind it was laughable that such a dramatic price difference would ever justify whatever ethical incentive there might be to put dollars towards Apple instead of Amazon. And such a giant price different between two competiting companies didn't make sense. Something just didn't make sense.</p>

<p>So we decided that because Amazon didn't offer the show as a series, we'd check the price of each season. After a quick minute of clicking through a dumb smart tv interface on a remote, the answer unveiled itself. Amazon was charging $60 to rent the last season of the Sopranos. That would make the cost of watching the show, with only rental permissions, was $110. And AppleTV was charging $125 for the series. It was the clue we've been looking for!</p>

<p>I personally found this to be extremely deceptive. If you chose Amazon because of the price, and you invested yourself into 5 seasons of 13 hour long intense tv drama, no way you're going to be able to turn that down even at cost. And you wouldn't be able to buy the individual seasons from anywhere else, at least anywhere I stream from. So you'd have to pay the $50 you paid to watch the first 5 seasons for the final season! Gotcha! On balance I decided to definitely buy the show from Apple not only because I would own it for an extra $15, but because thats such a scammy thing for Amazon to do and for $15 I'll support an honest communication of price. It definitely seemed like it was a well-hidden price gouge. I just checked to grab pictures for this post and now Amazon is selling for the first 5 seasons for $25 each and the last season for $50. So the prices are comparable now, but the scam still stands, but now you'd just end up spending $25 that you thought you didn't have to IF you chose Amazon over Apple to buy the Sopranos. </p>

						<p>On June 3rd 2020 I would have used the following words to describe my feelings towards the police: Reform. Regulation. Reason. My digital trail from that day includes phrases like: “I don’t think we should defund the police” and “the police are hopefully working to protect the protestors.” However, the wanton violence and excessive force I saw the evening of June 3rd is seared into my memory; it has irrevocably and changed my opinion about the state of law enforcement in America.</p>
<p>On that Wednesday night, I joined a protest walking through Central Park toward the Upper East Side, heading for Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the mayor of New York City. The entire park near the Mansion was barricaded by police, reaching it was impossible. After a powerful 8 minute silence among thousands of people, we moved south down York. The protest remained completely peaceful, and we occasionally stopped to take a knee.</p>
<p>Just before 9pm, an hour after the city-wide curfew took effect, at 60th and 3rd Avenue, I began seeing sirens at the back of the protest, about 3-5 blocks behind the front of the group, where I was located. We continued walking south, where I noticed the west side of 51st street, home of the 17th precinct, was fortified with barriers and police with firearms. Less than a minute later, numerous police vehicles, riot police, and bicycle and motorcycle mounted police swarmed the front - and as I later learned the rear* - of the protest. The police charged into our unarmed contingent of soft flesh in full body armor, swinging their batons indiscriminately and with impunity. The crowd of two thousand people – peaceful and unarmed – was now boxed in and being attacked by police on three sides. The police began amassing more units to block crosstown blocks and build a larger perimeter, a tactic known as “kettling”. The feeling in the crowd shifted from unity and solidarity to sheer terror as claustrophobia and panic set in. I can remember the look of panic in people’s faces as police crashed into us, violently beating those unfortunate enough to be caught in the front; the message this sent was loud and clear.</p>
<p>I managed to escape on my bicycle east on 50th Street to 2nd Avenue, and I continued riding south, where I saw more police vehicles en-route to the organized assault I had just left. I cut west on 45th Street, five blocks south of the police line, thinking I was now safe. As I approached the intersection of 45th and Lexington, a man yelled at me and another cyclist, “THEY’RE HERE! THEY’RE HERE! FIND ANOTHER WAY.” As I rode through the intersection, I saw several bikes strewn in the street. Groups of police tackled cyclists that were heading southbound. I could not believe my eyes. At this point there were police visible north, south, east, and west of my location. I froze, not knowing where to go. Another cyclist I was with was also panicking. “We’ve got to go, NOW!” he said. We decided to continue heading west. I had another 50 blocks home, in torrential rain. The police were everywhere. I felt a pit in my stomach each time the red and blue lights flickered around me. It was chaos. It was just dumb luck I made it home that night.</p>
<p>Many of my friends were not so lucky, they were arrested and brutalized by the police. The media covered the story, but did not paint the full picture. In an official statement Chief Monahan said that the police warned us to go home before making arrests. In the same statement, Monahan also appealed to looting as a justification for his attack, despite no reports of looting on the entire island at the time the assault. Chief Monahan was a man I respected after I witnessed
him take a knee with protestors at Washington Square Park the day before. Unfortunately I am no longer of the same opinion after seeing his vicious, coordinated attack on innocent people, and his subsequent lies to the public. The news did not cover the police tackling people off of their bikes five blocks away from the protest. It was heartbreaking to see pictures and videos of the people I was just with being beat with batons and laying facedown on the street. These were people who had their hands up, evidenced from the picture below, which was taken moments before the attack:</p>

					Look closely at what the police are wearing. Here is an article that covers what happened at 50th Street and 3rd avenue that night. Watch the videos <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/live-protest-updates-after-earlier-curfew-arrests-and-looting-decline">from here.</a></p>
					<p>This occurred an hour after the 8pm curfew. Some may think that is a justification for the violence, as we knew that we were in violation. But the curfew is a scare tactic that empowers the police, criminalizes protest, and is being used as a reason to attack people indiscriminately. Things like the curfew are the type of action that need to be resisted- these police-state scare tactics are only being deployed to mute people’s voices and literally beat down pleas for the police to stop their violence. Most disturbing is the curfew has little to do with “law and order.” I am a resident of the SoHo neighborhood, an upscale shopping district where many of you have
probably seen videos of large groups of people looting stores, starting fires, and causing mayhem. I witnessed this firsthand; I saw the police watch from across the street as my neighborhood was destroyed. I watched my neighborhood devastated by looters with impunity. Where were the police then? Why did the police do nothing to stop this? I watched over ten officers stand around a small trash fire talking and laughing for over 15 minutes while glass shattering echoed around the corner. Why did I watch the police allow my neighborhood to be looted, and two days later watch them violently assault a peaceful protest?</p>
<p>I can only speculate. Maybe they wanted to make the mayor look bad. Or maybe, they wanted to let those videos of destruction and chaos surface to sway public opinion and justify their subsequent use of force on peaceful, innocent people.</p>

<p>My views on the police have completely changed over the last few days. I have little respect left for the NYPD. The above is just my experience, which happened over the course of a mere three hours that felt like days. I think it speaks to the violence black people and other minorities face in this country daily. I can not imagine the terror some of our fellow citizens live with on a daily basis. My first-hand experience made me feel this pain and anguish more than any newspaper or television broadcast ever could have. Police are a danger to millions of people in this country. To the most vulnerable, they act as a hostile, occupying force. Their choice to attack protestors while turning a blind eye to looters leads me to believe they have a political agenda that is not in the interest of the people. They are a weaponized force that is designed to defend their monopoly on violence at all costs. They do not want to disarm. They do not want to be held accountable. We need major defunding of police, massive police reform, and civilian reviews with real power to keep citizens of the US safe.</p>

				  	<p><b>In Absentia</b></p>
				  	<p>Its been a minute. For anyone who has come here since April 13th the get some bomb content; I apologize. I have been really busy with some stuff that I would like to talk about on here, at some point, but -  now is not the time. However, what I will do in the meantime is produce some low effort content for the good readers of this blog and hope that it is at least somewhat entertaining! </p> 
				  	<p><b>Melancholy</b></p>
				  	<p>I used to be more emo than I am now. My AIM username was goodbyecruelwor1d. Its actually still on my Facebook, which was a catalyst for many laughs and jokes when my college friends uncovered this information during our freshman year. Anyways one of the things I loved to do in highschool, and still now to some extent, was taking pictures. I originally used a DSLR, but I was able to take a film class, offered by my school, where we shot 35mm film, and then through the process of manually developing the prints. in the darkroom. Recently somebody had so kindly reached out to me with the first print that I had ever developed. It came out pretty well- and I still love the picture. The piece was called "Life & Death".</p>

				  	<p><b>Livin the Dream</b></p>
				  	<p>Another day living the dream. Last night I went to bed late, and this morning I woke up early. I am not a great sleeper- I might suffer from a bit of insomnia. This is a problem during these times because oftentimes I just want to sleep to pass the time, especially on the weekends. I'll plan to get up at noon, at which point its already halfway through the day, and I wouldn't have to spend so much time crammed inside feeling the angst from quarantine. But alas, I will wake up at 7:30am and by the time noon rolls around I felt like I've already lived out a whole day. And I dont nap either.</p> 
				  	<p><b>Rain</b></p>
				  	<p>Something nice about today though was the rain. Normally in the city, the rain sucks because I am guaranteed to have to walk at least a mile outdoors, and no umbrella will keep you dry for that long. But today I got to watch the heavy rain and strong winds from the safety of my apartment. There is a tree on the street outside of my apartment thats at least 50 feet high, and the branches are so long they actually extend out and touch our windows. It was oddly comforting to hear the rain slapping the windows and the branches from the trees scraping the windows during strong gusts of wind; all from the comfort of my apartment.</p>

				  	<p><b>Greetings</b></p>
				  	<p>Hello good people! And readers of my blog! (not necessarily overlapping). Quarantine has become a time where I am doing a bunch of things, in addition to my job, so I have not been making daily posts, and it will most likely stay that way. I'm grateful to have a job still but its been just as busy as ever, if not moreso. Because our clients are generally in the financial industry, specifically oil and gas, it is pretty important everyone is taking care of and the software is running smoothly. Oil has taken a huge hit recently, which causes stress for those involved in that line of work; ensuring our software does not become a problem for them is especially important at this time. I'm aiming to get 3-4 posts in per week, in addition to continually updating the website design, and building out some of the other pages. You might have noticed that the navigation has recently changed. Despite quarantine being busy, I am starting to go a little crazy- at the end of the day theres just not much space to move around in the apartment. Keeping up excercise, personal hygiene, and eating habits is important....but at any given time 1 or 2 of those things is falling to the wayside. Maybe this week I will make a point of excercising a few times. Thanks internet.</p> 
				  	<p>I miss seeing my friends and family. I miss going to work because I don't like working from home (although it is growing on me). I miss not feeling fearful when I walk outside. I miss going to stores and restaurants that have since shuttered. And I'm sad about all of the people affected by this virus.</p>
				  	<p>Not sure if you guys have seen the news or not but the USNS Comfort ended up with Coronavirus infections, and despite protests, begrudgingly converted itself to a Coronavirus ship. Its not like I want to say "Told ya so!", but just following up on that post.</p>
				  	<p>One of the things I am doing is figuring out if, and where I will go to law school. In late December/early January I sent out my applications. Getting to that point where I submitted was a lot of work. I started by studying for the LSAT; this was difficult because I had to study after work, and I usually don't get home until 6 or 7. Theres one coffeeshop in the area, Think Coffee on Mercer, that is open until 10. All of the other coffee shops, and most libraries, are already closed by that point. By the time I got home, quickly grabbed a bite to eat (maybe), and got ready to go, I was already pretty tired from the workday. Think became like a second home. I studied quite a bit for the LSAT and ended up doing not as well as I wanted too, and scoring significantly lower than my practice exams. This was a bummer- but it goes to show that nerves and mindset play a huge role in performance, in tests or in anything else. The practice tests were just older versions of the test, so its not like they were any easier or harder. After the test I had to chose schools, and after choosing schools I had to write essays. The main essay was a personal statement of roughly 1,000 words. The good thing is that I wrote one solid personal statement, and the modified it to meet each school's criteria. However writing a personal statement is always difficult, it requires thinking of something unique or novel about yourself, figuring out how to spin it in a positive manner, creating a story around it, and tying that story into your law school aspirations. There were also additional, smaller essays for each school. I also had to get three letters of reccomendation, which at times was challenging, yet overall it can just produce some uncomfortable experiences. Lastly I had to fill out all of the applications, largely filled up with somewhat mundane questions about your eye color and what year your mother/father (if not deceased) was born. Then I clicked submit. The last part was pretty easy, though. It is really exciting to have gotten acceptances and scholarships to some schools I wanted to go to. I think I'm going to end of attending Boston College, but I am a little hesitant about leaving NYC, which has been my home for the last 10 years. If I end up going, I will certainly miss everyone. Also if I end up going, there better be no zoom classes, because law school is expensive!</p>
				  	<p>So if you saw yesterday's post I made a video! This is the first video I ever edited and I am quite proud of myself for doing it, despite the outcome not being the best. Part of that was just the video I ended up shooting wasn't so good. Honestly I have been thinking about video ideas/wanting to create a video for years, so this was a huge step for me. In addition to just really loving youtube/tv/films myself and wanting to give back by creating content, video editing seems like a really important and valuable skill. Not everyone can read but everyone can watch TV. Also video is a great way to distribute ideas, knowledge, or entertainment. With increased computer power and faster networks, video has become ubiquitous. Most of us probably don't think twice about streaming a video on youtube, despite how complicated and resource intensive it is. Video is really a powerful way to tell a story. Think about how you can just slap some clips together and put a soundtrack over it and all of the sudden it becomes a really poignant, interesting piece of media. Sometimes when I see videos like this I imagine what it would look like with no sound/editing, and just realize I wouldn't be watching it if it didn't have those things. So to sum that all up I think video is really cool and I hope to practice more and get to use it for something important one day. </p>
				  	<p>Another thing I've been doing is studying for the FAA Private Pilot Knowledge Test. This is one of the steps, in addition to a medical exam, flight lessons, and a practical test, that is required to obtain a pilots license. Flying is something I have always loved, and getting a pilot license is something I have been considering for the last 4-5 years. I was originally going to go for a helicoptor license but I decided theyre too dangerous, impractical, and expensive. I am super excited about getting into aviation and learning to fly; this is the beginning of a hobby I hope I can maintain throughout my life. There are two types of licenses I am interested in: Sports Pilot and Private Pilot. A sport pilot requires less flight hours, in addition to being cheaper, so I may start with that upgrade when I have the time and resources. That being said, condensing your training schedule is the most efficient way to complete the lessons, because it will be easier to remember something you learned 2 days ago vs something you learned 2 months ago. Also, while for example the minimum flight time you need for a sports license is 20 hours, that is just a minimum. It is left up to the instructor how many hours a student needs on a case-by-case basis. If you spread out those twenty hours over say, 12 months, the instructor may very well make you fly more hours in order to refresh and make sure you have the hang of everything. The table below outlines the differences between sports licenses and private licenses :  </p>

I'm definitely planning to make more videos now that I know how to do it (kind of), and I enjoyed making this one.</p>

		    	<p>Its strange how quiet it has gotten on the streets around me. The neighborhood I live in is residential but is probably more well-known for retail, and is definitely a destination for tourists. If you have seen 'A Quiet Place' its kind of like the beginning of the film, where the family is in the pharmacy downtown grabbing supplies. The streets have started to feel significantly less safe when the sun starts setting. This is definitely at least in part due to the lack of people; the number of people on the streets is a the most significant predictor of street crime (source not cited). But theres way more homeless encampments running along my street where there was none before. I was assaulted near Washington Square Park the other day, and now whenever I approach within 2 blocks of Washington Square Park people immediately start trying to sell me drugs. Kind of strange. I definitely don't get this feeling during the day when the sun starts going down...it feels like its time to make haste towards home.</p>

		    	<p><b>Greetings</b></p>		    	
		    	<p>Its been two days since I updated this. The main reason is that I was feeling lazy and out of energy so I was not really thinking about anything, which means I had nothing to write about. Additionally as usual, I have been watching a lot of YouTube, and seeing the amount of effort the people I follow put into their content, made me want to try to make better posts. I'm saying this because it means I did not want to just slap something random up here like for example I did on April 2...and all the days before that. A theme is really helpful for doing that. Originally this website had no theme and no purpose...and then when the blog was created the original theme was COVID-19, which I could stick to for the time-being. The downside of writing about COVID, from a non-scientific perspective, is it is impossible to avoid the political angle of the crisis. Oftentimes politics is frusturating to me, I assume readers do not care to read about it, and I do not feel great about forever recording my barely-informed, minimally researched political opinions on the internet. The other thing about COVID is that it is becoming more depressing; more people are sick and dying in the US (especially New York). The parts of the world with the most vulnerable populations are just starting to see their first cases. I remember a few weeks ago the death rate from the virus was seen as something like 1-2% in countries with healthcare systems like China/Europe/US. Now the worldwide death rate is over 5%. However the virus has yet to even hit places like refugee camps, and seems to be just beginning to majorly impact places without healthcare systems. The other component is the quarantine, the reality of which is beginning to settle in. Its been a month cramped in a 400? square foot apartment, and theres probably at least another month and a half of this (if we go by the results of a previous poll). Yikes. Actually one of the things I want to do while stuck in quarantine is determine the actual sq footage of my apartment...maybe I will do that today...</p>
		    	<p>Continuing on the COVID-19 discussion from the previous paragraph: It is pretty amazing that California has about 12,000 infected people. Although this is definitely a surprise to me, it really seems like California that their shit together with this one. California had its first recorded case in January 25th...so now its about 2.5 months later and they have only 12,000. I am pretty sure New York gets another 12,000 cases like, everyday. So anyways its actually been <b>72</b> days exactly since California's first recorded case. I'll do some basic math to compare the containment results in California vs that in Louisiana; Louisiana also has about 12,000 cases now. Louisiana had its first case on March 9th. Its been <b>26</b> days since Louisiana's first recorded case. Okay simple math time : </p> 
		    	<div class="row table-row">
			  	  <div class="col-3"></div>
				  <div class="col-6">
		    			<li>California's case count has doubled about <b>12.5</b> times :  (1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128+256+512+1024+2048+4096+ (.5 * 8192) ~= 12000)</li>
		    			<li>Lousiana's case count has also doubled about <b>12.5</b> times :  (1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128+256+512+1024+2048+4096+ (.5 * 8192) ~= 12000)</li>
		 				<li>California's doubled 12.5 times over a course of 72 days. This means the case count doubled every 72.5/12.5 = <b>5.8</b> days</li>
		 				<li>Lousiana's doubled 12.5 times over a course of 26 days. This means the case count doubled every 26/12.5 = <b>2.78</b> days</li>
		    		</ul>

		    	<p>Wow...thats a huge difference. It makes me kind of sad to know this whole thing did not have to be nearly as bad as it is now</p>
		    	<p><b>Tiger King (Carole Baskin)</b></p>		    	
		    	<p>This is pretty topical right now. Everyone seems to have watched it. I was even talking to some customers in Switzerland and Ireland last week who asked me if I had seen it. Anyways it seems like a lot of people think that Carole Baskin actually killed her estranged ex-husband, Don. While it remains a possibility that Carole killed her husband, she most likely did not. Lets talk about the reasons : </p>
		  		<div class="row table-row">
				  <div class="col-3"></div>
				  <div class="col-6">
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>The main proponent of the Carole killing Don conspiracy is Joe Exotic. Lest we not forget Joe has no credibility. Joe is a criminal, charged in a murder for hire plot, who was a tiger-killing criminal and certified lunatic</li>
				  		<li>Don was always cheating on his wives</li>
				  		<li>Don was always in Costa Rica</li>
				  		<li>All of the cat keepers introduced in the show, besides Carol, are sketchy, raging criminals.</li>
				  		<li>Don owned a numbers of planes that he flew "under the radar" despite not having a pilot license</li>
				  		<li>Don's best friend told us Don constantly hid money and gold in the ground or in places other than banks</li>
				  		<li>Don's last words to his friend were "If I can pull this off it will be the slickest thing I've ever done"</li>
				  	</ul>
				  </div>
				  <div class="col-3"></div>
				</div>
				<p>What does this mean? It means there are a number of possibilities other than Carol murdering Don. Maybe Don had a second family in Costa Rica and escaped to go live with them. Maybe Don got in a plane crash. Maybe somebody wanted Don dead and he had to skip town. Maybe Don's plane crashed. Who knows. But jumping to the conclusion that Carol murdered Don is a little rash.</p>
				<p><b>Cats</b></p>
				<p>There is a post below where I show off the three kitten's we've been living with. Unfortunately all three of them have been adopted; two of them have already been picked up, and the last one is getting picked up today. I've been starting to really like these cats so its a shame. But the resident Bear has been starting to get pretty bothered by them so I guess its all for the best that they go off on their way. Heres a picture of the remaining kitten, Cadillac : </p>

				<p><b>Being Petty</b></p>
				<p>I did a super passive-aggressive neighbor thing the other day that I am not proud about but I think it needed to be done. In my building you are supposed to bring the trash/recycling downstairs, outside, and then open a door that leads to an alleyway on the side of the building. It is way too frequently that people will just leave their trash/recycling in front of the door to the alleyway; this means if you are doing the right thing and want to put away your trash, you need to move all of their stuff. Again- this happens all the time. So the other night I saw a couple of the small boxes still had shipping addresses on them. Not going to lie I brought those boxes up to the apartment where they originally came from and left them in front of the door. I feel bad about doing that until I remember how annoying what they do it!</p>
				<p><b>Personal Accomplishment</b></p>
				<p>Some of you may know...I have a problem biting my nails. It is something I have done for <i>at least</i> the past ten years. My nails were always short, jagged, and bleeding. It was pretty gross. Additionally I find it really annoying when people bite their nails. A month and a half ago I embarked on a serious effort to make my nails beautiful again. I started by covering my nails and the skin around my nails with a nail-polish like product that was graciously gifted to me by my friend @Katie from the brand ONXYS called "STOP the bite" (pictured below); I did this every two or three days for about a month. This part really sucked. The polish makes your nails taste horrible, and everything you touch also takes on the nasty, bitter taste. For example if you're eating a sandwich with your hands, you'll taste it. If you lick some melted chocolate off your fingers, you'll taste it. The list goes on. This polish is really effective in conditioning you to not put your fingers anywhere near your mouth. There are many products that are supposed to do this, but this is the only one I have found to be effective. Anyways after using this for about a month, and sufferring from the bitter taste constantly, I became conditioned to not bite my nails. It is really that easy. I will show some before/after pictures below. Note: I don't have any pictures of my nails that were explicitly from before, but I found some pictures that adaquately pictured my nails.</p>

		    	<p><b>WFH tmrw</b></p>
		    	<p>Isn't it so crazy that you can feel or be busy all day, sitting at a table in your house, doing work or other things like talking to friends and family, and nothing changes? At the end of the day you're still sitting in the same spot, you're the same person, and nothing has changed. I guess its just that officeworkers are really abstracted from the work they actually do.</p>
		    	<p>I keep seeing all of these headlines (ya i dont read articles) about this pandemic changing the landscape of commercial office space, and how our situation is illustrating that companies can have employees work at home to save on silly things like conference rooms and desks for employees. There are real benefits to increased WFH (or partial WFH setups) like reduced congestion on roads and public transit, people being able to work more instead of commuting, and generally happier people. But are not the people who are saying this already on a team that has established relationships, communications, and trust between people. We have forged relationships with our colleagues and co-workers through years of the 9-5 grind. You cant pull that out of thin air. Like imagine hopping on a zoom conference with twenty strangers, and being given millions of dollars to create an system for scheduling delivery of electricity more optimally to consumers because the power grid is being strained by our collective societal shift to electricity from fossil fuels, and the 1inch x 1inch face on your screen thinks <i>this</i> is the time we're gonna show Exxon who is boss.</p>

			<p>Hey people. Its today. The day after yesterday and the day before tomorrow.</p>
			<p><b>USNS Comfort</b></p>
			<div>
				<img src="img/usns_comfort.jpg" class="center">
			</div>
			<p>As many of you know, especially you who live in New York, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Comfort_(T-AH-20)">the Mercy-class hospital ship USNS Comfort</a> docked in New York City yesterday (March 30th). This behemoth of a ship was originally an oil tanker, before being converted into a hospital ship in 1976. The boat is designed to supply the Marines, Army, Air Force, and Navy with rapid and mobile medical and surgical capabilities. Crewed by about 1300 personnel, including about 1,150 medical professionals, the boat provides about 1000 hospital beds for patients. The ship is unarmed; if the ship were to carry offensive weapons it would be considered a war crime.</p>
			<p>So the USNS Comfort has been moved to New York to augment the capacity of the city's hospital systems as coronavirus patients take up an increasingly large proportion of hospital services. The ship is going to be used to treat non COVID-19 patients to relieve the burden on hospitals. But from my perspective on the cushioned armchair, it seems that one infected person getting on the ship will undermine that whole mission. Lets take a look at the numbers that I have used to come to this conclusion:</p>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>The <b>most</b> conservative estimate of COVID-19 patients, which is the official reported number of cases, is about 80,000 New Yorkers. We know realistically that for every reported case, there are about 10 that go unreported, so the real number is much higher. 45,000 of those cases are in NYC. But lets use the <b>45,000</b> number to represent the number of sick people in NYC.</li>
					<li>The ship will hold 1300 personnel and 1000 patients. So lets use <b>2,300</b> as the total number of people who will be on the boat. Again, this is a <i>conservative</i> estimate because patients and doctors onboard will rotate, making the number of unique visitors greater.</li>
					<li>The population of New York City is <b>8,600,000</b> million people.</li>
					<li>So lets use division to get the ratio of COVID-19 patients to non COVID-19 patients (using the most conservative of estimates) : 45,000 / 8,600,000 = <b>0.00523</b> </li>
					<li><b>Finally</b>, lets multiply the ratio by the number of people on the ship : (2300 * 0.00523) = <b>12.</b></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>So these numbers lead me to believe that statistically speaking, if the ship is filled to capacity on day 1, 12 of those people will have COVID-19. It then seems like the virus will be liable to spread quickly throughout the ship given that space is generally tight on any boat, and cruise ships have proven to be a very dangerous place during this pandemic. The thing is once people on the boat become sick, the whole operation is compromised. Could you justify sending medical personnel and patients onto a boat where the virus is known to be? If not- everyone would have to evacuated. It would seem that it would make the most sense to designate the ship as a COVID-19 hospital, give the staff the proper PPE to operate it as such, and relieve the worry about the ship becoming a contamination zone. There might be a reason for not doing this that is as simple as 'the ship is not prepared to handle a scenario like COVID-19 and so cannot commit to doing so'.</p>
			<p>Maybe theres flaws in my assumptions and logic..if there is please feel free to point them out. I just became fascinated with the boat because it is huge and has been used as a field hospital all over the world; so this was on my mind. Please let me know what you think by participating in the survey below : </p>

		    	<h6>March 30th part deux</h6>
		    	<p><b>Breaking stuff</b></p>
		    	<p>One thing that I have been experiencing is <b>breaking stuff</b>. Specifically I am talking about kitchenware- glass cups, ceramic spoon rests/pots, and things like that. I have broken several pieces of kitchenware that I had some sentimental attachment to recently. I am not sure if this is because I am just being extremely careless and just moving around like a brute, or if its because I am home all of the time, and so there is way more opportunities to <b>break stuff</b>. But I wouldn't consider myself to be the most mindful/careful person when it comes to day-to-day movement. Either way this is starting to get really frusturating, and I am started to lose coveted kitchenwares.</p>
		    	<p><b>Follow your Energy</b></p>
		    	<p>A colleague (yes colleague, not co-worker...Im kinda classy like that...oh yeah and I have clients, not customers) of mine said this today in a meeting. Might not be applicable to everyones' situations, but I kind of like the idea. It was said in the context of a discussion about how to stay sane, mentally healthy, and focused while in this quarantine. I suppose what it means is if you don't feel up to doing the task at hand, if you don't feel like you have energy for it, do something that you do have energy for. It also means that you shouldn't feel confined to working "standard" hours e.g. 9-5. Do what you can when you want to. Working in tech, for the most part, we have this privilege, but for example if you have to work market hours than thats that. Keep reading bc it don't apply to you</p>
		    	<p><b>Going public</b></p>
		    	<p>You might be aware, yesterday I made the hasty decision to make this thing public. It was rash, and I was a little embarassed because none of these posts have been proofread, or even re-read. My boss could read this, my coworkers, friends, and family. Fuck. <i>Its easy to be brave on the internet.</i> I think every word on this page was written without being read. Now I am even more hesitant to read them as I know some of you have read them. I also write these posts in an editor that doesn't even have a spell-checker. But now that we're here, I'm planning to put up some real juicy content out in the coming days and weeks. I think if you follow along, you will be satisfied. I'm also going to re-design this thing because it looks like it was created by a third grader in 1995.</p>
		    	<p>March 30th part three coming later tonight...</p>
			    <p>Alright I am going to post more content later this afternoon, but for the time being I can't keep you good people waiting for the results of the last survey. Everyone has been calling/texting/emailing me non-stop and so I figured I'd expedite this...</p>
			    <p>We had seven respondents answering yesterday's question which was: "Would you take the over or under on quarantine ending by May 15th". The responses were as follows : </p>
			    <div>
			    	<ul>
			    		<li>100% of the respondents (7 people) answered : "Over; Definitely still going to be trapped in our houses through May 15th!"</li>
			    		<li>0% of the respondents (0 people) answered : "Under; I think the quarantine will be over by May 15th!"</li>
			    	</ul>
			    </div>
			    <p>So I think theres a unanimous consensus that, unfortunately, we will still be in quarantine through May 15th. Thank you to everyone who participated/voted in the last poll! Without you we wouldn't have been able to discern this crucial data. <b>And</b>, I'm out for now, but check back later tonight for an extended post and probably a new poll</p>

		    	<p>I posted the link to this site on my Instagram. HAH! hahaha. I am truly sorry if you are reading this; the only reason you would be is because you're in quarantine. Hiding out in your house to escape an enemy you cannot see or hear, the CORONAVIRUS! But a quick note on Instagram; it has become the new Facebook. But the haters will say; "You know Instagram is owned by Facebook right?". Yeah I know, but Instagram used to have a unique feel to it; it was cool..it was "relevant". Then it became really popular and people started to juice it for capital. I mean people make careers out of Instagram. Tons of ads now, especially when you're watching stories and then an advertisement for HIMS hairloss product pops up. WTF. And I cant have a "swipe up" unless I have 10,000 followers?! How do you even get 10,000 followers? Basically the cycle continues: people make/find a social media platform (also applies stuff like gentrification), people make good, interesting content, then someone monetizes it and it slowly becomes worse and worse. Remember: there was a time in our lives when facebook was cool.</p>
		    	<p>Remember when the president said American would be open for business by Easter. When he said that I thought Easter was like late April or something...but its April 12th! Yeah I think hospitals will be open for business by April 12th...maybe they'll even have the supplies they need. But this whole discussion begs the question: When do we emerge from our houses and begin our lives again. Lets pick a date; May 15...would you take the over/under on the quarantine ending by May 15th?</p>

I think because I am using the <b>free</b> tier of SurveyMonkey, they don't allow multiple surveys. Anyways with that in mind I thought I would share the results of the last survey. The question was about how the cleanliness of your house has changed since quarantine started. There was a whopping 3 survey answers. The respondants said the following : </p>
			    	<ul>
				    	<li>66% of respondents (2 people) answered : "My house has been somewhat cleaner since the beginning of quarantine."</li>
				    	<li>33% of respondents (1 person) answered : "My house has been significantly cleaner since the beginning of quarantine."</li>
			    	</ul>
			    	<p>You do the math. People out here cleaning their houses more during the quarantine.</p>

		    	<p>ITS SATURDAY!!!! Second best day of the week after Friday. However Friday is caveated because its really after you get out of work on Friday which is the best. You don't have to worry about going to bed late because you have two subsequent nights to straighten out your sleep schedule. Its also normally a relaxed night in general because everyone is tired from the work week and no one is really pushing for excessive social or recreational activities. Last night I stayed in (duh), chatted up some friends and family on video conferencing apps (see last post), and watched "Ex Machina". Spoiler alert for those who have not seen it: I can't believe Ava leaves Caleb for dead in the research house! I mean it makes sense- if they both left, someone who have to become accountability for the murder which would blow up both their spots. But still- that was a cold-blooded move. Only one a heartless AI-driven piece of scrap metal could make. Brutal</p>
		    	<p>I am thinking of re-naming this page from events to blog. When I began my first post on this page it was named current events- and so I naturally chose to begin writing about the coronavirus. However as time passes, and posts about cats and other subjects begin to be covered, I think this should page should be broadened. I might even create a set of categories within this page to make it easy to switch between different types of subjects (I know a TON of people read this so I really should make usability the most important thing). However this is just to say that you should expect to see a lot of different content on this page from here on out, and possibly an entire re-format. On a related note- I did recieve a request from a user/viewer to add a comments section to these posts. I think that is a funny/interesting idea that will make the page a lot more entertaining. <b>Please comment your thoughts about that idea below.</b> The only problem with that is that I will have to add a backend, create an API, and because I am hosting this on the most basic of basics- Github pages- I will probably have to change my hosting service (No hate for Github pages- they made setting up this website really really easy- but the capabilities are limited when you get to applications with servers).</p>
		    	<p>There was a train fire in NYC yesterday. It looked absolutely horrifying. The fire is thought to be a criminal act, related to similar fires at other stations in the same area that day. There was a picture of a burned out train car that really made me sad. Its a similar sadness to that of seeing the streets of NYC empty. Two days ago I took a bikeride up to central park and rode a lap around the park. While the park was busy, riding the 60 blocks north and south were not. On my way home riding south I actually rode through Times Square and did not even notice I was there for a minute because of how empty it was. The streets around iconic New York landmarks like 30 Rockefeller, Radio City Music Show, The Tonight Show, and the Late Show were completely barren. More than interesting or shocking, these sites made me sad.</p>
		    	<p>Now for a coronavirus related thought (please take this with a grain of salt because I am not a doctor, public health expert, economist, or lawmaker). Yesterday a 2.2 Trillion dollar stimulus bill was passed. That amount of money is absolutely shocking, given that we don't have the cash to pay for it, and so my generation and the generations after me will be footing the bill. The virus only seriously harms, and in unfortunate cases kills, a small percentage of people like the elderly and the immunocompromised. Healthy and less-healthy people are unlikely to see serious damage especially if the medical system is prepared. Even vulnerable groups are less likely to realize negative consequences if hospitals are adaquately stocked and equipped to take patients. I <b>wonder</b> why we could not have taken a fraction of that 2.2 Trillion dollar stimulus, lets say between 100-200 billion dollars, let "healthy" populations continue to participate in economic activity while encouraging social-distancing measures, hand-washing, micro-quarantines in outbraek areas, and other public health initiatives. With the money we could have immediately mobilized a huge workforce to build hospitals and source/create adaquate medical supplies; meanwhile we could have imposed a quarantine on vulnerable populations and provided them with services they would need to flourish while under quarantine. This would provide us with a medical system sufficient to care for anyone and everyone that gets sick, and relieve the need of spending 2.2 Trillion dollars to bailout an economy that will now be on pause indefinitely (and may very well require more capital injections). Again I am no economist, buy if this 2.2T debt could cause economic issues down the road that could very much also create great human sufferring. This idea may seem a bit callous- but to my knowledge, the fatality rate of the disease is very much impacted by the ability of healthcare systems to absorb the vast amount of patients.</p>

				  	<p>In the time of quarantine, many people have taken to video conferencing software to remain connected with friends and family, continue their jobs, and pass the time. However with so many choices, which software is right for you? This largely depends on concerns such as the reason you are using video-conferencing, the people you are conferencing with, and how how much you care about your online security.

		  		<p>Katie and I have a full-time cat at home we call Bear. Katie has had bear for close to seven years now. But in addition to bear, we also foster cats, and sometimes kittens, from Best Friends Animal Society in Manhattan (BFA). BFA needs fosters for several reasons. When BFA recieves a cat from animal control (which is where all of their cats come from), it must be kept away from other cats for a minimum of ten days as to not potentially pass on any diseases it may have. Additionally sometimes the cats have known issues, and so foster parents take care of the cats, which often includes trips to the vet and administering medicine, until the cat get well and can be adopted out. As fosters we do not handle any of the logistics for adoption, besides returning the cat(s) to BFA. Additionally BFA gets many kittens so small that they need to be specially cared for (kept in a sterile kitten room) and bottle fed. When kittens get big enough to leave the kitten room, but not big enough to be spayed/neutered, which is a requirement for adoption, they go to foster parents. The foster parents will make sure the kittens are growing at the correct rate, take them to any necessary vet appointments including their spay/neuter surgeries, and then return the kittens to BFA where they will be adopted.</p>
		  		<p>Right now we have three black kittens: Cadillac, Ford & Lexus. We have actually had these kittens for close to a month and a half, and they have already been spayed and neutered, but because of the virus situation, we are still holding on to them. When we got them they were under one pound- now they are well over three pounds. They are growing quickly and getting crazy. While they sleep 80% of the time, the other 20% of the time they go absolutely wild. Here are some pictures : </p>

		  		<p>I decided to respond to a politically charged comment on Facebook today. The tone of my response was light, but it was attacked pretty harshly. I responded by telling the person that I bet everything I own that they did not read one word of the proposed bills, and if they indeed had read the bills, please post links to them. Three hours later I had the two PDF's above. These are links to the Republican's and Democrat's proposed econoimc stimulus bills. In addition, this facebook user has provided me with a good resource to source future bills (that I will then post here). Additionally, the facebook user was able to pwn a libtard on the interwebz. All is right in the world...Except for the pandemic.</p>
		  		<p>Also working from home really isn't too bad.  I could really get used to it. Its nice to have a full kitchen to cook lunch in, and the cats running around. It takes a little discipline but its really not bad for now.</p>

Great. Put in a folder, scoop out the grinds, and get the coffee going. It smells amazing...after a few minutes I am starting to get ready to pour a cup. Then I remember- no milk. Oh shit. Do I go out and grab milk or drink it black? Fuck it...this is America...I'm getting the goddamn milk. Okay shit I spent my last five bucks yesterday....I've got a jar of cash in the kitchen but thats supposed to be for a vacation..a vacation that is beginning to seem more unlikely. Okay where is Katie's wallet...cant find it. I'm diving into the jar to grab a five. Its cold and I'm barely wearing any shorts...so I know I'm not going to the grocery store. I'm going to the corner store....Kim's. Kim's has milk, but also a bunch of people in it. Fuck it. Buy the milk. Liter for $3.49. Woman behind the counter is wearing a mask...hands me to one dollar bill, two quarters, and a penny. Left that shit in the jacket pocket because I dont want any virus.</p>

		  	<p>New York State is now on PAUSE. PAUSE is an acronym for "Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone". In the coming days it will be interesting to see how seriously this is enforced. I hope that it will be used to break up social gatherings instead of targeting individuals getting some fresh air- but that remains to be seen. Its also unclear what punishment will be used to enforce this. Hopefully will work to slow to tranmission rate and give us some time to ramp up the hospital system and source adaquate supplies</p>
		  	<p>There was also some news from Washington today that a coronavirus stimulus bill package worth 1.8 Trillion dollars failed to pass in the Senate in a 47-47 vote. I have been unable to source the primary text of this bill, but I can only assume it attempted to swindle in some inappropriate measures during a time of crisis. Apparently the bill extended a line of credit worth close to 500 billion dollars to the Federal Reserve to bailout unspecified industries. I consider this to be a serious waste of taxpayer money and another stain on the current administration. The fact that the government has not invoked its powers to help manufacture and distribute desperately needed medical supplies, while at the same time using trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out industries, is deeply troubling. I think the juxtaposition of the proposed stimulus package, along with the guise of a "small federal government" being used to justify not invoking the Defense Production Act, shows the current administration to be hypocritical; hypocritical even when their "ideals" will be paid for up-front with American lives, and maintained by bleeding the country of future prosperity as our credit rating drops with our credibility, and interest payments pile up. The Trump Organization recieving any of this bailout money would be absolutely unacceptable. I hope the politicians representing us will do whats right.</p>
		  	<p>S&P futures are currently down about 5%. Theres going to be a whole lot more economic pain tomorrow morning. I hope this doesn't force the Democrat's hand to pass an incomplete and harmful bailout plan.</p>
		  	<p>On a more personal note, today marks a week almost completely quarantined in my apartment. There are definitely ups and downs, sometimes it can be deeply depressing, especially with everything thats going on, and sometimes it can be actually quite nice to have some actual free time, free from external pressures, to sit and think. But the main point of this post is that I am not excited at all about another week working from home. My apartment simply isn't large enough to really seperate my work life from my home life (which is my entire life now). I am hoping I will be able to slowly adapt to a working from home situation by sticking to a routine and just being dilligent with my state of mind as I approach each work day. Working as a software developer, I am granted a large amount of autonomy to begin with, and largely I am the person who makes sure I am accountable. And so working from home it can be easy to get sidetracked. I am intent on getting into a good routine with work both because it will help pass the time and well, because it is my job. The feeling of accomplishment after a day's work is better than not doing much work and being on youtube all day. Plus, I can watch youtube on my commute home. </p>

		    	<p>Day 6 of quarantine. Today I left the house to go for a walk, and it felt amazing. I truly had not left the house for a few days and this was much needed. But that sweet taste of the outdoors, of freedom, was so sweet, that I ended up going on two other walks. The direction that I walked in at each intserction was the one with the least people, as well as routes where there was no visible scaffolding. I avoided scaffolding because it tends to get dark and dingy underneath it, the air tends to feel stale, and it generally feels less clean that a sidwalk without scaffolding.</p>
		    	<p>I listened to Cuomo's address this morning. It was pretty surreal to see the journalists seated in chairs 6 feet away from eachother. I was encouraged to hear that as of 8pm Saturday evening, all non-essential businesses were being shuttered. However when I did a bit more research, I found of list of essential businesses, and it was sobering to see what is considered essential. Many of these businesses are essential, and NYC has a GDP that is close to 2 Trillion dollars, which is close to 10% of the GDP of the entire USA. This area is so vital the US economy, and the list of essential businesses reflects this point. The following are considered to be essential businesses (sourced from

				<p>I am trying to get the exact number, and this post will be updated later if I find it, but the MTA ridership was over 1 million people today. If just 1% of those people are infected, 10,000 people exposed countless others to the virus today. We cannot expect everything to shut down but the public health costs of not doing so are beginning to look staggering. Today for the first time, I felt a simple sadness about the situation; sadness about the human tragedy we are beginning to suffer through </p>

		    	<p>Day four of my quarantine. Prior to that, I had been in a state of semi-quarantine and practicing a social distancing regime. My scope into daily life in Manhattan is limited by what I can see through my living room windows overlooking what is normally a busy intersection in the SoHo neighborhood. There are minimal people outside; the usual nightly music from the bars and restaurants, despite having been muffled recently by a zealous neighborhood association, is completely muted. However, there is the sound of an occasional car or truck driving by. I wonder how serious people around the city and the state have been in heeding the reccomendations of our governor and the more recent guidelines from the president. What is worrying me is that despite efforts by many of us to restrict the spread, their are still so many people who are out and about every day.</p>
		    	<ul>
		    		<li>Medical professionals</li>
		    		<li>MTA (including Metro North & LIRR), Port Authority, NJTransit workers</li>
		    		<li>Critical government employees</li>
		    		<li>Cashiers and other grocery store workers</li>
		    		<li>Sanitation</li>
		    		<li>Police</li>
		    		<li>Fire</li>
		    		<li>Chefs</li>
		    		<li>Couriers</li>
		    		<li>Air Traffic Control</li>
		    		<li>Janitorial staff</li>
		    	</ul>
		    	<p>These industries must include tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people in the NYC area. And not included are all of the people who are not heeding quarantine and social distancing guidelines, or are taking them seriously but are taking a much needed stroll or walking their dog. It seems like even with our best efforts the virus may still spread to many more people. On a lighter note- most of our snack food has been depleted. Everything remaining needs to be cooked or otherwise prepared somehow. Maybe this is a good thing though.</p>
